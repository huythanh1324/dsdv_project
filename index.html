                        The bar chart shows the carbon dioxide emissions factors for various energy sources. It compares the CO2 emissions produced per unit of energy (measured in kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour) for different sources, such as coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables. It can be seen that Blast Furnace Gas activity produce the most C02 into the air

                        CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are emitted when we burn fossil fuels, produce materials such as steel, cement, and plastics, and grow the food we eat. If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.

                            The chart illustrates the variation in global average surface temperatures over time. Each line on the chart represents a specific year, showing the monthly average temperatures. The chart reveals trends and anomalies in temperature changes, highlighting overall warming patterns and seasonal fluctuations from 1990 to 2020. You can explore this data interactively to understand how temperatures have shifted over the decades.

                            Activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release CO2 into the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect. This traps more heat, leading to global temperature rises. The result <i style="color: black"><b>is more extreme weather, decreasing % land covered by forest, rising sea levels</b></i>.

                <p class="chat-bubble right">Forest area recovery in Europe and Australia since 2000 is due to effective policies, afforestation/reforestation programs, sustainable management, and economic shifts away from agriculture.</p>
                <p class="chat-bubble right">The continuous increase in forest area in Asia since 1990 is largely driven by extensive afforestation and reforestation programs, government policies promoting forest expansion, and efforts to combat deforestation through sustainable practices and conservation initiatives.

As global temperatures have increased due to greenhouse gas emissions have contributed to a steady rise in sea levels. The data indicates that as the rate of temperature rise has accelerated, particularly since the late 20th century, the rate of sea level rise has also increased, highlighting the impact of climate change on oceanic and coastal systems.</p>

                <p class="chat-bubble right">Rising global temperatures contribute to the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Warmer temperatures lead to more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, and wildfires. The enhanced evaporation rates and increased moisture in the atmosphere fuel more intense storms and precipitation events. Additionally, higher temperatures exacerbate droughts and increase the risk of forest fires, while melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to sea-level rise, which amplifies the impact of coastal flooding and storm surges.</p>
